# CodeQuiz
A coding quiz that relies on dynamically updated HTML and CSS, powered
by JavaScript. The user is given 15 seconds to answer each of the five
questions. After they are answered all of the questions, or the time has
ran out, then the user will be given their score. They then have the
options to quit, replay, or record their score to a locally stored
list of high scores.
